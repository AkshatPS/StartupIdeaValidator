## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized in a monorepo-like structure with three main components:

- `/client`: The React frontend application (Create React App).  
- `/server`: The Node.js/Express backend API, database models, and authentication logic.  
- `/agent`: The Python/Flask microservice for AI-driven idea analysis.

## ‚ö° Getting Started

To run this project locally, you will need **Node.js, Python, and MongoDB** installed and running on your machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkshatPS/StartupIdeaValidator.git
cd StartupIdeaValidator
```
### 2. Setup the Backend Server
```bash
# Navigate to the server directory
cd server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file and add the required environment variables (see below)

# Start the server
npm start
```

### 3. Setup the Python AI Agent

**Refer this repo:** [https://github.com/AkshatPS/StartupValidatorAI](https://github.com/AkshatPS/StartupValidatorAI)

### 4. Setup the Frontend Client
```bash
# Navigate to the client directory from the root
cd client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env.development file and add the required environment variables (see below)

# Start the React app
npm start
```

## üîë Environment Variables
You need to create .env files for the server and client to store sensitive keys and configuration.

### server/.env
```bash
MONGO_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING
JWT_SECRET=YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY_FOR_JWT
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET
SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
FLASK_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
### client/.env.development
```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

## üåç Deployment

This application is deployed on Render as three separate services from a single repository:

Static Site: For the React frontend (/client).

Web Service: For the Node.js backend (/server).

Web Service: For the Python AI agent (/agent).

‚öôÔ∏è Rewrite rules are used on the frontend service to correctly handle client-side routing for the single-page application.
